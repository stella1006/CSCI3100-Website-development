# Recipe Wizard

Project  Recipe Wizard is initiated on request by Professor Michael Lyu as to make an activity planning and sharing platform. We thus decided to create a website that help people plan their meal and share their experience with others. The project aims at providing a dynamic and elegant platform for people packing up a menu with recipes created by users. It also provides recipe recommendations personalized to the individual's tastes, digital recipe box (namely "menu") and menu/recipe search.
